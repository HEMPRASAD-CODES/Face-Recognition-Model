# Face-Recognition-Model
Overview
This project implements a robust, professional face recognition system using state-of-the-art deep learning and computer vision techniques. The system is designed to detect and recognize faces in images and videos, supporting multiple recognition backends and providing a flexible, modular architecture suitable for both research and real-world applications.

Features
Multiple Face Detection and Recognition Methods:
Supports face_recognition (dlib), MTCNN+FaceNet, and OpenCV DNN, with automatic fallback to the best available method.

Custom Feature Extraction:
Includes traditional feature extraction (LBP, gradients) as a fallback for environments without deep learning libraries.

Database Management:
Easily add, remove, and list known persons. Encodings are stored and managed efficiently for fast recognition.

Image and Video Recognition:
Recognizes faces in static images and real-time video streams, displaying results with bounding boxes and confidence scores.

Extensive CLI and Notebook Support:
Includes a command-line interface for scripting and automation, as well as notebook-friendly functions for research and demonstration.

Benchmarking and System Info:
Tools to benchmark recognition speed and display system configuration.

How It Works
Data Preparation:

Organize known faces in subdirectories (one per person, multiple images per person).

The system scans these directories and creates a database of face encodings.

Model Initialization:

Automatically selects the best available detection and recognition backend.

Falls back to traditional methods if deep learning libraries are unavailable.

Recognition:

Detects faces in input images or video frames.

Extracts encodings and matches them against the database using distance or similarity metrics.

Displays results with bounding boxes and predicted names.

Database Management:

Add new persons with a single command or function call.

Remove persons or list all known identities.

Usage
Basic Steps
Prepare Dataset:

Place images of each person in a separate folder under a main directory (e.g., known_faces/John_Doe/).

Create Encodings Database:

Run the system in training mode to scan images and create face encodings.

Recognize Faces:

Use recognition mode to identify faces in new images or videos.

Example Commands
bash
# Train the system (create face database)
python face_recognition_system.py --mode train

# Recognize faces in an image
python face_recognition_system.py --mode recognize --image path/to/image.jpg

# Real-time recognition from webcam
python face_recognition_system.py --mode video

# Add a new person
python face_recognition_system.py --mode add --name "John Doe" --image path/to/john.jpg

# Remove a person
python face_recognition_system.py --mode remove --name "John Doe"
Technologies Used
Python 3

OpenCV

face_recognition (dlib)

MTCNN

Keras-FaceNet

PyTorch (optional)

scikit-learn

NumPy, Pillow, Matplotlib


Applications
Access control and security systems

Attendance tracking

Photo organization and tagging

Research in face recognition and computer vision

Notes
The system is designed to automatically select the most accurate and available recognition method.

For best results, provide multiple clear, front-facing images per person.

Supports both notebook and command-line usage for flexible deployment and research
